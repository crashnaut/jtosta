# J. Tosta - Website for Psicologa Jaqueline Tosta

Personal website for psychologist Jaqueline Tosta, built with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm run dev

# Build for production
pnpm run build

# Preview production build locally
pnpm run preview
```

## Deployment

This site uses a staging-to-production deployment workflow with Firebase Hosting:

- **Staging Environment**: https://tostamente.web.app/
- **Production Environment**: https://jtosta-com.web.app/ and https://jtosta.com/

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI if you haven't already
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Deploy to staging (default)
npm run deploy
# or simply
firebase deploy

# Test the staging site at https://tostamente.web.app/

# When ready, promote staging to production
npm run promote-to-prod

# If needed, deploy directly to production
npm run deploy:prod
```

The workflow is designed to:
1. Deploy changes to staging first for stakeholder review
2. Promote to production once approved without rebuilding
3. Allow direct production deployment when needed
